## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|--------|------------|
| Framework | [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org) (App Router) |
| UI | [React 19](https://react.dev), [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com) |
| Charts | [Recharts](https://recharts.org) |
| Database | SQLite (`dev.db`) |
| ORM | [Prisma 7](https://www.prisma.io) + `better-sqlite3` adapter |
| Forms | [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com) + [Zod](https://zod.dev) |
| Auth | Custom sessions (`bcryptjs` password hashing) |

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20 or later (LTS recommended)
- **npm** 9+ (or pnpm / yarn)
- **Windows:** [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) may be required for `better-sqlite3` native compilation

---

## Getting started

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdulSamadSaleem1208/QuickBooks-style-workflows.git
cd QuickBooks-style-workflows
npm install
```

If `better-sqlite3` fails to load on Windows, rebuild native bindings:

```bash
npm rebuild better-sqlite3
```

### 2. Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

> `.env` is gitignored. Never commit secrets or production credentials.

### 3. Database setup

```bash
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed
```

This creates the SQLite database, seeds the chart of accounts, users, tax rates, cost centers, and **demo transactions** (customers, invoices, bills, etc.) when the database is empty.

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

On **Windows**, if Turbopack fails with a native SWC error, use Webpack instead:

```bash
npm run dev -- --webpack
```

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser.

### 5. Sign in

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|--------|----------|
| Admin | `admin@financebook.com` | `admin123` |
| Accountant | `accountant@financebook.com` | `accountant123` |

> These accounts are for **development only**. Change or remove them before any public deployment.

You can also load sample data from the dashboard via **Load sample data** (calls `POST /api/seed`).

## API overview

REST-style handlers under `src/app/api/`:

| Area | Endpoints |
|------|-----------|
| Auth | `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout` |
| Core | `/api/accounts`, `/api/journal`, `/api/cost-centers` |
| AR | `/api/customers`, `/api/invoices`, invoice payments |
| AP | `/api/vendors`, `/api/bills`, bill payments |
| Ops | `/api/expenses`, `/api/payroll`, `/api/employees`, `/api/inventory`, `/api/receipts` |
| Reports | `/api/reports/profit-loss`, `balance-sheet`, `general-ledger`, `cash-flow` |
| Dashboard | `GET /api/dashboard` |
| Admin | `/api/users`, `/api/settings`, `/api/tax`, `POST /api/seed` |

All protected routes require a valid `session` cookie.

## Deployment notes

- **SQLite:** The default setup stores data in `dev.db` at the project root. Serverless hosts (e.g. Vercel) need a **persistent volume** or a switch to PostgreSQL/MySQL.
- **Production database:** Update `prisma/schema.prisma` datasource and `DATABASE_URL`, then run migrations against the new provider.
- **Security:** Rotate default passwords, use HTTPS, and set secure cookie flags in production.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `'next' is not recognized` | Run `npm install` |
| `better-sqlite3` bindings error | Run `npm rebuild better-sqlite3` |
| Turbopack / SWC error on Windows | Use `npm run dev -- --webpack` |
| Dashboard shows zeros | Create transactions or use **Load sample data**; DRAFT records are included |
| `/reports/cash-flow` empty | Record payments on invoices or bills first |
